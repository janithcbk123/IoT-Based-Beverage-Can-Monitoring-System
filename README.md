# IoT-Based-Beverage-Can-Monitoring-System
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity capabilities. These devices can collect and communicate data, enabling them to interact with each other and with humans, creating a seamless and intelligent ecosystem. In recent years, the popularity of IoT has increased exponentially. This can be attributed to the increasing availability of affordable and reliable connectivity options, advancements in sensor technology, and the growing demand for automation and data-driven decision-making. IoT has found applications in various sectors, including smart homes, industrial automation, healthcare, agriculture, and transportation, transforming the way we live and work. Its potential to enhance efficiency, improve productivity, and create new business opportunities has fueled its rise in popularity and made it a significant driver of technological innovation. This IoT-based beverage can be monitored using the MQTT protocol. System to monitor a number of beverage cans and their temperatures using micropython and the MQTT protocol.

## Objectives
1. Develop a system to gather data about temperature and availability of beverage cans inside a refrigerator.
2. Implement MQTT protocol to view the gathered data through a mobile app.
3. Add option for displaying the exact number of cans remaining in the container.
4. Add option for viewing status changes inside the container in relation to time.
